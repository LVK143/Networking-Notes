1. OSI Model
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact to enable communication between computers.

It has 7 layers:
| Layer Number | Layer Name   | Function                                | Example/Analogy                 |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 7            | Application  | Interface for user applications         | Web browsers, email clients     |
| 6            | Presentation | Data formatting and encryption          | SSL/TLS encryption              |
| 5            | Session      | Establishes and manages sessions        | Logging into a remote server    |
| 4            | Transport    | Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)        | TCP ensures data packets arrive |
| 3            | Network      | Routing and addressing (IP addresses)   | IP addresses, routers           |
| 2            | Data Link    | Physical addressing and error detection | MAC addresses, switches         |
| 1            | Physical     | Physical medium and transmission        | Ethernet cables, WiFi signals   |


Example: When you type a URL in your browser and hit Enter, the data you send and receive travels through all these layers â€” from Application (your browser) down to Physical (your network cable or WiFi) and back up on the receiving side.
